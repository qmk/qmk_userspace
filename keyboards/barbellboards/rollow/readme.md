Author's Note: Converting my ZMK Rollow to QMK, I decided to port/modernize Barry's Rollow keyboard definition. Setting up a new definition here as his github account shows no activity since mid 2022. Ultimately, this is a fun exercise for me to better understand how to setup a new keyboard especially under the new standards. I take no credit for Barry's awesome hardware design.

A compact 40% (12x4) ortholinear keyboard kit made and sold by OLKB and Massdrop. [More info on qmk.fm](https://qmk.fm/planck/)

## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader in 3 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the key at (0,0) in the matrix (usually the top left key or Escape) and plug in the keyboard
* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the back of the PCB - some may have pads you must short instead
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available
